Privacy Policy for Plant Tracker:
 
This application does not require, collect, or use any data. The google play store may use or collect data though.

The application will plants and gardens to a database and pictures to the /pictures public directory however this is all done locally. 

This policy is for version 1.0.

<br />
Google Data:<br />
It seems that some data is automatically collected by google play including visitors of the store page, install numbers, country and acquisition channel of install/visit, ratings, and the type of device giving the rating.<br />
All of this data will only be view privately by me apart from the install numbers which I may use in resumes or portfolios.<br />
Ratings will also be used publicy on the store page (this may also show the type of device giving the rating) and I'm not sure how google shows or uses the other data.
